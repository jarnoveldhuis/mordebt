# Automatic Bank Reconnection Feature

## Overview

The automatic bank reconnection feature allows users to maintain a persistent connection to their bank accounts without needing to manually reconnect each time they visit the dashboard. This enhances the user experience by seamlessly retrieving their transaction data while still maintaining security best practices.

## How It Works

1. **Access Token Storage**
   - When a user successfully connects their bank account via Plaid, we securely store the resulting access token.
   - The access token is stored with additional metadata including the user ID and timestamp.
   - This allows us to verify token ownership during reconnection attempts and implement token expiration policies.

2. **Automatic Reconnection Process**
   - When a user loads the dashboard, the system automatically checks for a stored access token.
   - If a valid token is found, the system attempts to reconnect using this token without requiring user intervention.
   - The reconnection process is transparent, with appropriate status indicators shown to the user.
   - If reconnection fails (e.g., expired token), the user is prompted to connect manually.

3. **Security Considerations**
   - All tokens are user-specific and verified against the current authenticated user.
   - Tokens have a 30-day expiration policy to ensure regular re-verification.
   - When a user logs out or disconnects their bank, the token is immediately cleared.
   - Different users cannot access each other's tokens, even on shared devices.

## Implementation Details

The feature is implemented across several components:

1. **`useBankConnection` Hook**
   - Core logic for storing and retrieving access tokens
   - Handles token validation and automatic reconnection
   - Manages the connection state and exposed transactions

2. **Dashboard Component**
   - Integrates the reconnection flow with the user interface
   - Displays appropriate loading and success states
   - Handles error cases gracefully

3. **PlaidConnectionSection Component**
   - Provides UI for both manual connection and reconnection status
   - Shows appropriate messaging based on connection state

## Usage Example

```typescript
// In your component
const { 
  connectionStatus,
  transactions,
  connectBank,
  disconnectBank,
  autoReconnectBank
} = useBankConnection(user);

// Attempt to reconnect automatically when component mounts
useEffect(() => {
  if (user && !connectionStatus.isConnected) {
    autoReconnectBank().catch(console.error);
  }
}, [user, connectionStatus.isConnected, autoReconnectBank]);
```

## Testing

The feature includes debugging tools for development environments:

- **Bank Connection Test Utility**: Verifies token storage and validity
- **Debug Panel**: Includes buttons for testing reconnection and clearing tokens
- **Connection Status Indicators**: Shows current state of bank connection

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Security**: Consider implementing more secure token storage using a dedicated secure storage API.
2. **Refresh Token Support**: Implement token refreshing to extend validity without requiring reconnection.
3. **Multi-Bank Support**: Allow users to connect and auto-reconnect multiple bank accounts.
4. **Connection Health Checks**: Periodically verify token validity and notify users of potential issues.
5. **Institution-Specific Handling**: Customize reconnection strategy based on specific bank requirements.
